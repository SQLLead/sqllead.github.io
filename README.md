# tophalf.github.com

Welcome to the repository that powers https://tophalf.github.com â€” a simple GitHub Pages site for showcasing collaboration projects and public repositories.

This README explains the site's purpose, how to preview it locally, how deployments work, how to edit content, and useful follow-ups (custom domain, theme, contact).

## Purpose

The Pages site is intended as a lightweight personal/project landing page that links to and documents collaborative work and public repos. Use this repo to keep the source for the site's content, configuration, and any static assets.

## Contents

- HTML / Markdown pages (site source)
- Static assets (images, icons, css)
- GitHub Pages configuration (if present)

Edit the files in this repository to change content on the site.

## Previewing locally

If the site is a plain static site (Markdown/HTML), preview locally with a simple HTTP server. From the repository root run:

```powershell
# from repo root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

If the site uses Jekyll (default for GitHub Pages) or another static site generator, install the required toolchain and follow that project's preview steps. Typical Jekyll preview:

```powershell
# install Jekyll (requires Ruby)
gem install bundler jekyll
# install dependencies if a Gemfile exists
bundle install
# serve locally
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
# open http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

Note: Adjust commands above depending on your platform and toolchain.

## Deployment

GitHub Pages will publish content from this repository automatically when pushed to the `main` branch (or to the branch configured in the repository settings). No additional CI is necessary for basic static sites.

If you use a static site generator or CI workflow (GitHub Actions), check the repository for `.github/workflows` and follow the workflow's instructions.

## Editing the site

- Make changes on a feature branch and open a pull request to `main`.
- Keep content modular: put pages under a `pages/`, `docs/`, or root folder depending on generator conventions.
- Commit static assets under `assets/` or `images/`.
- Update the site configuration (e.g., `_config.yml` for Jekyll) when changing global settings.

## Custom domain (optional)

To use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file with your domain at the repository root and configure the DNS records with your domain provider as described in GitHub Pages docs.

## License

If this site contains original content you want to license, add a `LICENSE` file to the repo. A permissive choice is the MIT license. If you're only hosting links to public projects, consider whether those projects' licenses apply to their content.

## Contact

For questions or collaboration, open an issue in this repository or reach out via the contact details in your GitHub profile.

If you'd like, I can:

- Add a short site index/homepage HTML or Markdown file
- Configure a Jekyll scaffold or a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to build the site
- Add a `CNAME` template or example `Gemfile`/`package.json` depending on which generator you prefer

Tell me which of the above you'd like next.
